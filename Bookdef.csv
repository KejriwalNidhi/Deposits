Why do people ask Quora question which can be answer easily by Google?,"Here’s the thing, just because an answer is readily answered with Google, does not mean it is readily as easily clear or understandable. This is especially true about technical questions. Everytime I need to answer a question, I start with a Google search too. However, since I’m familiar with the topic, I can easily filter out unhelpful search results.

Moreover, many of these answers also contain other technical terms which might not be familiar to someone who hasn’t studied that subject. A person with expertise in that field can make the answer more helpful by simplifying it so that it can be understood by a layman, consolidate information from different sources to form a more interesting, coherent, comprehensive answer, and add explanations, metaphors and analogies where required. A search engine cannot do all that.

Yes, some people might simply too lazy to Google, but one cannot make that the default assumption. It is better to assume the question is sincere, not just for the person who posted the question, but to everyone else who reads it later."

How do I read and find my YouTube comments?,"Since you have public access to the comments on public channels, theoretically you could make a bot that loads the comments for a video and then filters out just the user you are looking for. If you had it comb through using the info from that users ‘liked’ video’s list you’d have a much greater chance of finding comments.

I'm not sure what you stand to gain from gathering a list of all the comments they’ve made, but I suppose that if you were a watchdog entity you could use that data to show patterns of ill-intent. So it might be useful from a community guideline standpoint to have that info. I'd be willing to bet that Youtube has developer access to that data, since comments must be stored somewhere.

But as others have mentioned, there is no way to /easily/ do so.

And if you were to use your bot to search EVERY video on EVERY channel, you’d need an enormous amount of bandwidth and computing power to make an appreciable impact on the flood of content uploaded to Youtube.

But before you ask if you could, maybe you might ask why you should?"

What happens if you put milk in a coffee maker?,"Assuming it is a automatic drip coffee maker, I like Shawkat Halim’s answer - with this subtle addition: it will be a foul, unusable mess in <2 weeks. There will be NO WAY to clean it to prevent the mold and souring and scalded milk solid mess - short of disassembling the thing to its bones after every use.

I would guess that if you continued to use it in spite of the stink & bad taste, it will be race to machine failure caused by either [burned out heating element] or [no longer dripping]. The root of either of these failures will be cooked on milk blockage in the siphon tube.

Percolator is washable. However, in addition to the dishwasher, I believe you will need to use a few pipe cleaners to prevent the same blockage & taste/stink in the vertical perc tube. Since it works by bringing the liquid to boil, you most definitely will end up with scalded / blackened milk on the bottom that needs to be scrubbed off. Same with a moka pot, with the added uncertainty of the way the pressure chamber deal with the milk. How the regulator responds (or doesn’t) when it gets too hot would be interesting.

To end on a positive note, I would go with a pour-over or french press. :)"
